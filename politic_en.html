                                        <br><br>The private company <b>“Nadis Group Limited”</b> recognizes the importance of information privacy. This policy applies to all products, services, and websites offered by the Nadis Platform, its subsidiaries, or partner companies (hereinafter referred to as “services”). Additionally, where more detailed information is required to explain privacy measures, we publish specific notices describing how individual services process personal information.
                                        <br>The private company <b>“Nadis Group Limited”</b> adheres to nine privacy principles (notification, choice, onward transfer, security, data integrity, access, enforcement, etc.). If you have additional questions about the privacy policy, please contact us through our website nadis.kz.

                                        <br><br><b>1. Collection and Use of Information</b>
                                        <br>We offer services that can be used without an account or providing personal information. An example of such services is WHOIS lookup. The domain names you request information about are not published anywhere, although the request history is stored in our database as part of monitoring service usage.
                                        <br>Cookies. When users visit the Platform’s websites, we send one or more cookies to their computer. This is a small file containing sets of characters that allows us to identify the browser. We use cookies to improve the quality of our services by saving user preferences and tracking user behavior trends, such as during searches. Most browsers are initially set to accept cookies, but users can completely disable cookies or configure notifications for their use. However, without cookies, some functions or services may not work properly.
                                        <br>Log Information. When you use the Platform’s services, our servers automatically record information that the browser sends when visiting a website. Such server logs typically include the requested web page, computer IP address, browser type, browser language settings, date and time of the request, and one or more cookies that allow precise identification of your browser.
                                        <br>User Communications. We may retain email messages and other correspondence sent by users to process user inquiries, respond to requests, and improve our services.
                                        <br>Affiliated Sites. Some of our services are offered in collaboration with other websites. Personal information provided to these sites may be sent to the Platform if necessary to provide the service. We process this information in accordance with this privacy policy. Privacy measures may differ on affiliated sites, so we recommend reviewing them.
                                        <br>Links. The Platform may provide links in a format that allows tracking whether visitors use them. This information is used to enhance the informativeness of our services.
                                        <br>Other Sites. This privacy policy applies to websites and services owned and operated by the Nadis Platform. We do not control sites displayed in search results or links provided in our services. These sites may place their own cookies or other files on your computer, collect data, or request personal information.
                                        <br>The Nadis Platform processes personal information only for the purposes described in the relevant privacy policy and notices related to specific services. In addition to the above, these purposes include the following:

                                        <br>The Nadis Platform processes personal information on its servers located in the Republic of Kazakhstan.

                                        <br><br><b>2. Choices Regarding Personal Information</b>
                                        <br>When you register for any service, we ask you to provide personal information. If we need to use this information for purposes other than those for which it was collected, we will request your permission in advance.

                                        <br><br><b>3. Information Sharing</b>
                                        <br>The Nadis Platform may share personal information with other companies or individuals not affiliated with the Nadis Platform in the following specific circumstances:

                                                <br>(a) comply with any applicable laws, regulations, legal processes, or government requests;

                                        <br>We may share certain aggregated, non-personal information with third parties, such as the number of users who searched for a particular query or clicked on a specific advertisement. This information is not used to identify users.

                                        <br><br><b>4. Use of Financial Information</b>
                                        <br>Financial information (e.g., bank account details) is used by us solely to issue invoices for ordered services. If you pay for services using a credit card, the card information may be forwarded to the credit card provider to process the payment.
                                        <br>Disclosure of financial information may occur only if required by judicial or audit authorities in cases provided for by law.

                                        <br><br><b>5. Information Security</b>
                                        <br>We take appropriate security measures to prevent unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure, or destruction of data. These include internal reviews of data collection, storage, and processing policies, security measures, and measures to prevent unauthorized access to facilities where data storage systems are located.
                                        <br>Access to personal information is granted only to those Nadis employees, contractors, and agents who need it to manage, develop, or improve our services. These individuals are bound by confidentiality obligations and may face disciplinary action, including termination, as well as legal prosecution for violating these obligations.

                                        <br><br><b>6. Data Integrity</b>
                                        <br>The Nadis Platform processes personal information only for the purposes for which it was collected and in accordance with this privacy policy and any applicable notices developed for specific services. Our data collection, storage, and processing policies are regularly reviewed to ensure that we collect, store, and process only the personal information necessary to provide and improve our services. We take possible measures to ensure that the processed personal information is accurate, complete, and valid, but we rely on users to update or correct their personal information when necessary.

                                        <br><br><b>7. Access and Updating of Personal Information</b>
                                        <br>We make good faith efforts to provide users of the Nadis Platform’s services with access to their personal information, correct it if it is inaccurate, and delete it at the user’s request, unless it conflicts with the law or is required for legitimate business purposes. Users must identify themselves and the information they wish to view, correct, or delete before such a request is processed. We may refuse to process requests that are unreasonably repetitive or systematic, require disproportionate technical effort, jeopardize the privacy of others, or are impractical (e.g., requests concerning information stored on magnetic tape backups) or for other reasons. We provide access and corrections free of charge, except in cases where it requires disproportionate effort. Some of our services have different procedures for accessing, correcting, or deleting personal information. Details about these procedures can be found in the relevant privacy notices and frequently asked questions for those services.

                                        <br><br><b>8. Enforcement</b>
                                        <br>The Nadis Platform regularly reviews its compliance with this privacy policy. If you have questions about the privacy policy or how the Nadis Platform handles personal information, please contact us through the website nadis.kz. According to our policies, upon receiving a written request, the Nadis Platform is obligated to contact the sender to resolve the issue. Any questions about the transfer of personal data that the Nadis Platform and the user cannot resolve independently will be addressed with the relevant regulatory authorities, including local data protection agencies.

                                        <br><br><b>9. Changes to the Privacy Policy</b>
                                        <br>Please note that the privacy policy may change periodically. Your rights under this privacy policy will not be reduced without your consent, and we expect most changes to be minor. Nevertheless, all changes to the privacy policy will be published on this page, and if the changes are significant, we will provide broader notification, including, for example, email notifications.
